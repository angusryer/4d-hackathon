# Adidas Hackathon

## Intro
Over 24 hours, a team of 10 developers, UX designers abd data scientists, postulated, formulated and built a prototypical solution to an issuehtey identified related to how Adidas is positioning themselves as a market leader in sustainability. The problem is that while Adidas claims to support sustainable initiatives openly on social platforms and on their website, their customer-facing assets and user-experience implementations are busy and inelegant.

Team 6, of BrainStation's 4D Hackathon with Adidas, propose a solution. Team 6 is composed of:

### Web Development Team
- Angela Kim
- Zemen Teshome
- Hector Palacios

### UX/UI Design Team
- Cassia Napier
- Chris Donlevy
- Meg Cameron
- Michelle Moore

### Data Science Team
- Asch Harwood
- Kevin Sawczuk

## Solution Proposal
Preliminary analysis of social media data demonstrates a strong correlation between the presence of the "Parely" brand being used alongside "Adidas" and a significant uptick in user sentiment. Yet, in spite of this, Adidas themselves do not provide a coherent user experience on their media that showcases this fact. Team 6 proposes "Adidas 2.0" to be a distinct section of the Adidas web platform that showcases this and other sustainable Adidas products and brands.
